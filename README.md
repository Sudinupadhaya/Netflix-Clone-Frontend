Netflix-Clone-Frontend

This repository contains a simple Netflix homepage UI clone built using HTML and CSS. The goal of this project is to practice frontend basics such as layout design, positioning, typography, and styling by recreating a familiar real-world interface.

This is a static frontend project and does not include backend features like authentication, movie streaming, or dynamic data fetching. It is made purely for learning and UI practice.
